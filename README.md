# Mystia Hayami data

Aimed to build structured data of [*Touhou Mystia Izakaya*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1584090).

## Listed game and DLCs

* Main game
* DLC1

## Known issues

1. I currently have no way to check `game_id` in `data/main/foods/dishes.json` with confident.

## Todo

1. `data/main/characters/normal-guests.json`: fill names in `ja` and `ko`.
2. `data/main/characters/rare-guests.json`: fill `thwiki`.
3. Fill more info after bought the other DLCs.
4. Finish `data/interface`.

## Licence

Files under the `avatar` directory drawn by [二色幽紫蝶](https://x.com/youziKK), the original developer of *Touhou Mystia Izakaya*, are used are under fair use to show the relationship between structured data and avatars.
